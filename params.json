Because of this it has some\r\nexperimental extensions to normal R7RS scheme:\r\n\r\n  * First class environments via the library `(mickey environment)`\r\n    ([see examples](#environments))\r\n\r\nOther libraries include:\r\n\r\n  * Dynamic loading of shared libraries via `(unix dlopen)`\r\n    ([see dlopen example](#c-libraries))\r\n\r\nCurrent Shortcomings\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n  * It's __slow__: The code is completely interpreted, without _any_\r\n    optimizations.  I have plans to change this.\r\n\r\n  * It's __incomplete__: Some key Scheme features are still missing, and\r\n    quite some R7RS library functions (currently it supports 176 of 335\r\n    R7RS definitinos).\r\n\r\n  * It's __buggy__: There are inherent bugs in the engine as well as\r\n    erronous implementations of library functions.\r\n\r\n  * It does not collect __garbage__: Currently, there is no garbage\r\n    collector.  Adding a simple mark-and-sweep GC is trivial, though, so\r\n    I'll get to it once I think it's important enough.\r\n\r\n  * It doesn't support __continuations__ (yet):  I think I'll have to\r\n    convert to continuation passing style for a proper implementation of\r\n    this.\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n---------\r\n\r\nRun `make -j check` to perform a simple check, then `./mickey` to play with a REPL.\r\n\r\nThe project is not really release-ready, so there is no use of autotools.\r\nThe Makefile assumes you have `c++` installed.  If you want to compile\r\nusing `llvm-g++` or any other compiler, do something like:\r\n\r\n    CXX=llvm-g++ make -ej\r\n\r\nto compile using `g++` and in parallel.\r\n\r\nFeature flags\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n  * `-DUSE_READLINE` and `-lreadline` for readline support (including TAB\r\n     completion)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMickey R7RS Scheme\r\nCopyright (C) 2011-2012 Christian Stigen Larsen\r\n\r\nDistributed under version 2.1 of the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) while\r\nalso allowing anyone to change the license on a particular copy of the code\r\nto the LGPL 3.0, the GPL 2.0 or the GPL 3.0.\r\n\r\nSee the file COPYING for the full text of the LGPL 2.1.\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nChristian Stigen Larsen <csl@sublevel3.org> http://csl.sublevel3.org\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nHere are a few example code snippets for Mickey Scheme.  \r\n\r\nBesides demonstrating the basic capabilities of Mickey, it also serves as a\r\nkind of soft introduction to Scheme.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's start `mickey`.\r\n\r\n    $ ./mickey\r\n    #|                                                                 _\r\n       Mickey Scheme (C) 2011-2012 Christian Stigen Larsen              \\\r\n       4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 ((tags/Apple/clang-421.0.57))   /\\\r\n       Readline 4.2                                                    /  \\_\r\n\r\n       To quit, hit CTRL+D or type (exit).  Use (help) for an introduction.\r\n       Distributed under the LGPL 2.1; see LICENSE\r\n    |#\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the REPL, short for _read-evaluate-print loop_.\r\n\r\nFirst, you should note two things:  The `#| banner inside a comment |#` and\r\nthe `#;` symbol.  They make it possible to copy the code you see here and\r\npaste it directly into your own REPL, without needing to remove `mickey>`\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThe symbol `#;` means \"ignore the next symbol\"; so `#; mickey> (+ 1 2 3)`\r\nmeans that Mickey Scheme will skip `mickey>` and move on to `(+ 1 2 3)`,\r\nwhich it then will evaluate.  This is a known trick in scheme systems.\r\n\r\nNow, let's type some code.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (display \"Hello, world!\\n\")\r\n    Hello, world!\r\n\r\n## Lambda\r\n\r\nLet's play with lambdas.  First we'll create a lambda to square a\r\nnumber and execute it on the fly.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> ((lambda (x) (* x x)) 12)\r\n    144\r\n\r\nWe can it to a variable as well.  Let's bind it to the variable `square`.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))\r\n    #; mickey> (square 12)\r\n    144\r\n    #; mickey> (square 3.1415)\r\n    9.86902\r\n\r\nLet's have some fun with lambdas.  Let's create\r\na function that creates other functions.\r\n\r\nWe'll create a general function `make-adder` that\r\ncreates a function that can add a static number to another\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define make-adder\r\n                 (lambda (frozen-number)\r\n                   (lambda (x)\r\n                     (+ x frozen-number))))\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we give it a `frozen-number` and it returns\r\na lambda that takes a number `x` and adds the two together.\r\n\r\nSo to make a function that adds 5 to its argument, we simply\r\ndo\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define add5 (make-adder 5))\r\n    #; mickey> (add5 10)\r\n    15\r\n\r\nLikewise\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define add17 (make-adder 17))\r\n    #; mickey> (add17 10)\r\n    27\r\n\r\nWriting `(define (lambda (x) ...))` is tedious, so a\r\nshorter variant is available:\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define (cube x) (* x x x))\r\n    #; mickey> (cube 101)\r\n    1030301\r\n\r\nMickey uses GNU readline, so it offers both tab completion and history.  And\r\nit actually works, too.  Here we write `(ca` and hit `TAB` two times to see\r\navailable definitions.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (ca\r\n    caaar  caadr  caar   cadr   car  \r\n\r\nHere are `car` and `cdr`.  They extract the first and remaining items in a\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (car '(1 2 3))\r\n    1\r\n    #; mickey> (cdr '(1 2 3)))\r\n    (2 3)\r\n\r\nI like the old school \"car\" and \"could-er\" forms because you can compose them, so that you can extract the `car`\r\nof the `cdr` like so:\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (cadr '(1 2 3))\r\n    2\r\n\r\nThey might not be very interesting for flat lists, but they shine for\r\naccessing trees.\r\n\r\n## Arithmetic\r\n\r\nHere is some simple arithmetic.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)\r\n    55\r\n\r\nSummation of sequences can be calculated more quickly with\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define (seq-sum n)\r\n              (* n (/ (+ n 1) 2)))\r\n\r\nwhich gives us\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (seq-sum 10)\r\n    55\r\n    #; mickey> (seq-sum 100)\r\n    5050\r\n    #; mickey> (seq-sum 127)\r\n    8128\r\n\r\n## Let-forms\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the \"let star\" form.  It creates a local variable\r\nscope, and evaluates them in the given order.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (let* ((x 2)\r\n                      (y 3)\r\n                      (z (* x y)))\r\n                      (display z))\r\n\r\nThis, of course, prints `6`.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `letrec` form that allows for mutually recursive\r\ndefinitions.  Or in plain english, expressions that refer to each other.\r\n\r\nThe typical example of this is to implement `even?` and `odd?` in terms of\r\neach other:\r\n\r\n* A number is _even_ if the preceding number is odd, and\r\n* A number is _odd_ if the preceding number is even\r\n\r\nSince our definition is going to be mutually recursive, we need to handle\r\nbase cases of zero (negative values will make the code loop forever, though).\r\n\r\nLet's write that out, along with a `check-number` function.\r\n\r\n    (letrec\r\n      ((even? (lambda (n)\r\n                (if (zero? n) #t\r\n                    (odd? (- n 1)))))\r\n\r\n       (odd? (lambda (n)\r\n               (if (zero? n) #f\r\n                   (even? (- n 1)))))\r\n\r\n       (check-number\r\n         (lambda (n)\r\n           (display `(The number ,n is ,(if (even? n) 'even 'odd)))\r\n           (newline))))\r\n\r\n       (check-number 2)\r\n       (check-number 3)\r\n       (check-number 88)\r\n       (check-number 99))\r\n\r\nIf you run the above code in `mickey`, you'll get this output:\r\n\r\n    (The number 2 is even)\r\n    (The number 3 is odd)\r\n    (The number 88 is even)\r\n    (The number 99 is odd)\r\n\r\n## Macros\r\n\r\nNow, Scheme doesn't have a `when` function.  The `when` function checks\r\nwhether the first argument is true.  If it is, then it will evaluate --- or\r\nexecute --- the code given in the remaining arguments.\r\n\r\nYou can't do this with a simple function, because it would *always* evaluate\r\nthe code body.  As an example, let's say we have a boolean variable\r\n`green-light`.  If it's `true`, we'll format the hard drive:\r\n\r\n    (when green-light (format-drive))\r\n\r\nIf `when` was implemented as a function, it would always format the hard drive,\r\nbecause function parameters must be evaluated _before_ entering the function\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we need a way to _control evaluation_.  Scheme's macros\r\nwill let ut do exactly that.\r\n\r\nSo let's implement `when` as a hygienic macro.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define-syntax when\r\n                 (syntax-rules ()\r\n                   ((when test expr ...)\r\n                     (if test (begin expr ...)))))\r\n\r\nThat's it.  To demonstrate that we control the evaluation, let's create a\r\nfunction with a side effect that prints to the console when it's evaluated.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define (say-hello) (display \"Hello\\n\"))\r\n    #; mickey> (say-hello)\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\nCalling\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (when #f (say-hello))\r\n\r\ndoes not print anything, which is good.  In contrast,\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (when #t (say-hello))\r\n    Hello\r\n\r\ndoes indeed print to the console.\r\n\r\n## Quotation\r\n\r\nNow let's try some examples with quasi-quotation.  Since Scheme is a\r\nsymbolic language, we can easily create syntax trees for languages like SQL\r\nby just using quotation.  But sometimes we'll want to embed actual\r\ncomputations into them, so therefore we can use the specual `unquote` prefix\r\nwith a comma.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of just that.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define (sql-get-user name)\r\n                 `(select * from user where name = ,name))\r\n\r\n*Note*: _There is currently a bug in the mickey REPL, so that\r\nquasiquotation requires an extra closing parenthesis to parse.  \r\nThis bug is not present if you run this example from a file, though._\r\n\r\nRunning the function should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (sql-get-user \"foo\")\r\n    (select * from user where name = \"foo\")\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sometimes we want to splice two lists together when we quote.\r\nWe can do that by using unquote splice, or the `,@` prefix.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (define date '(2012 05 17))\r\n    #; mickey> date\r\n    (2012 5 17)\r\n    #; mickey> `(here is a date: ,@date)\r\n    (here is a date: 2012 5 17)\r\n\r\n## Lazy evaluation\r\n\r\nMickey Scheme also supports delayed -- or lazy -- evaluation.  That is,\r\ncomputations that are not executed right away.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all languages that support evaluation control (for instance, via a\r\nmacro facility) and first class closures should be able to *implement* lazy\r\nevaluation without any external library.\r\n\r\nLet's create a list `queue` that contains some code we want to execute at a\r\nlater time.\r\n\r\n    (define queue\r\n      (list (delay (display \"One! \"))\r\n            (delay (display \"Three! \"))\r\n            (delay (display \"Two! \"))))\r\n\r\nNow we want to execute the code in the list, but reordered so that it will\r\nprint \"One! Two! Three!\":\r\n\r\n    (force (list-ref queue 0))\r\n    (force (list-ref queue 2))\r\n    (force (list-ref queue 1))\r\n\r\nThis outputs:\r\n\r\n    One! Two! Three!\r\n\r\n## Environments\r\n\r\nMickey Scheme has an experimental library for first-class environments.\r\nIt bascially implements the API from MIT Scheme, with a few missing\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nHere is an example on how to use it.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's start up mickey with an empty environment (the -z argument).\r\nAn empty environment means that the REPL only has one definition, that of\r\n`import`.  We need `import` because to do anything, we need to be able to\r\nimport libraries.\r\n\r\n    csl$ ./mickey -z\r\n    #|                                                                 _\r\n       Mickey Scheme (C) 2011-2012 Christian Stigen Larsen              \\\r\n       4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)   /\\\r\n       Readline 4.2                                                    /  \\_\r\n\r\n       To quit, hit CTRL+D or type (exit).  Use (help) for an\r\n       introduction.\r\n    |#\r\n\r\nNow, let's just make sure that we don't have any binding for `foo`.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> foo\r\n    Unbound definition: foo\r\n\r\nLet's import the `(mickey environment)` library and define `foo` in a new\r\nenvironment that is a child of the current one.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (import (mickey environment))\r\n    #; mickey> (define sub-environment\r\n                         (make-environment\r\n                           (define foo 123)))\r\n\r\nWe still should not see `foo` in the current environment:\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> foo\r\n    Unbound definition: foo\r\n\r\nBut it should be available in the environment we have stored in the variable\r\n`sub-environment`.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (environment-bindings sub-environment)\r\n    ((foo 123))\r\n\r\nLet's import the `(scheme write)` library so we can call `display`, and then\r\nonly the `newline` function from `(scheme base)`.\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (import (scheme write))\r\n    #; mickey> (import (only (scheme base) newline))\r\n\r\nNow, let's evaluate an expression in the child environment to print the\r\nvalue of `foo`:\r\n\r\n    #; mickey> (environment-eval \r\n                 (begin\r\n                   (display foo)\r\n                   (newline)) sub-environment)\r\n    123\r\n    #; mickey> ^D\r\n\r\nSo, what's the point with first class environments?  You can use it do to\r\nstuff like implementing your own module system.  The reason they are not\r\npart of standard Scheme is because they make it very difficult to reason\r\nabout what a program does just by reading the code.\r\n\r\nTherefore, implementations are allowed to implement them on their own.\r\n\r\n## C-libraries\r\n\r\nIt's possible to write libraries in C and call them from Mickey Scheme.\r\n\r\nSince Mickey does not use a build system yet, the process is a little bit\r\ncumbersome.\r\n\r\nFirst you write a small library in C.  Let's say we want to be able to call\r\nthe `uname(3)` function from Mickey.  We'll just write some wrapper code in\r\nC:\r\n\r\n    #include <sys/utsname.h>\r\n    #include \"mickey.h\"\r\n\r\n    extern \"C\" cons_t* proc_uname(cons_t* args, environment_t* env)\r\n    {\r\n      struct utsname p;\r\n\r\n      if ( uname(&p) != 0 )\r\n        return boolean(false);\r\n\r\n      // Return utsname as an associative list\r\n      return\r\n        cons(cons(symbol(\"sysname\",  NULL), cons(string(p.sysname))),\r\n        cons(cons(symbol(\"nodename\", NULL), cons(string(p.nodename))),\r\n        cons(cons(symbol(\"release\",  NULL), cons(string(p.release))),\r\n        cons(cons(symbol(\"version\",  NULL), cons(string(p.version))),\r\n        cons(cons(symbol(\"machine\",  NULL), cons(string(p.machine))))))));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that if you use a C++ compiler with the above code, you must prefix the\r\nfunction with `extern \"C\"` to avoid the infamous C++ name-mangling.\r\n\r\nTo compile this, do something à la\r\n\r\n    gcc -shared -fPIC -I<mickey path> mickey-uname.c \\\r\n        -L<mickey path> -lmickey -o libmickey-uname.so\r\n\r\nThis should give you a libmickey-uname.so file.  To load this file from\r\nMickey, we have to start mickey and then import the `(unix dlopen)` library.\r\n\r\n    csl$ ./mickey\r\n    #|                                                                 _\r\n       Mickey Scheme (C) 2011-2012 Christian Stigen Larsen              \\\r\n       4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)   /\\\r\n       Readline 4.2                                                    /  \\_\r\n\r\n       To quit, hit CTRL+D or type (exit).

You can take a look in the `lib/` directory\r\nfor some ideas.  Note that you _have_ to import primitive functions to be\r\nable to use them, even core forms such as `define`.  Also note that even\r\nthough we define `rest` above, it is not exported, and thus not available\r\n_outside_ of the library.\r\n","tagline":"Mickey Scheme is an interpreter for R7RS Scheme written in C++"}
